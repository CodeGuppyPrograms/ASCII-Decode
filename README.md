Let’s say a friend is sending you a series of numbers representing an encoded secret message. If you know that your friend used ASCII encoding for the message, then decoding is very simple. Just use this program to do the hard work of figuring out what character corresponds to each code.

If you want to send encoded messages yourself, use the [ASCII Codes](tutorial://ascii_codes) program instead.
